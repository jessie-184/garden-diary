## Overview

### Description

A garden tracker app is a companion for gardeners, providing a wealth of information about various vegetables, allowing users to monitor the growth process of plants in their own gardens, and calculating the estimated time until harvest. The app enables personalized tracking through note-taking on each vegetable type being cultivated, while also featuring an educational resource that details common garden pests and offers guidance on how to manage them, creating a comprehensive tool for both planning and maintaining a successful vegetable garden.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Productivity/Lifestyle (Gardening)
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for on-the-go access in the garden to log observations, check information, and receive timely notifications about plant progress and potential issues. The camera could be used for photo documentation of plant growth, pest identification, and sharing progress. Location services could potentially be used for localized planting calendars or weather-related advice.
- **Story:** Empowers gardeners of all levels to cultivate thriving vegetable gardens by providing readily available information, personalized tracking, and proactive guidance. It transforms gardening from a potentially confusing endeavor into a more informed, organized, and rewarding experience, leading to more successful harvests and a deeper understanding of plant care.
- **Market:** Home gardeners of all experience levels, community garden participants, and even small-scale urban farmers could benefit from this app. Monetization could involve premium features like advanced analytics, personalized planting schedules based on location and last frost dates, expanded pest and disease identification with AI image recognition, or partnerships with local nurseries and seed suppliers.
- **Habit:** Gardeners would likely use this app regularly, especially during key gardening seasons. Daily or weekly use for logging plant progress, checking harvest dates, and reviewing pest information would be common. Notifications for watering, fertilizing, or potential pest outbreaks would encourage consistent engagement.
- **Scope:** V1 would focus on providing a vegetable information database with basic growth tracking and note-taking features. A real gardener with a small garden could test this. V2 would incorporate the harvest date calculation and basic pest information. V3 would add image capture for plant documentation and potentially basic reminders. V4 would integrate location-based features and explore more advanced pest/disease identification or community sharing of gardening tips.
